Description:
============

This plugin allows to undelete from deleted recordings for a short time

When a recording is deleted in VDR, the recording is just marked for deletion. 
The removal of the files and directories is done in the background after a certain idle time
or when VDR needs more diskspace.

In case this cleanup process has not run, you can recover your deleted recordings 
with this plugin.

The plugin can also show the size of the deleted recordings and and immediate deletion
can be triggered.


Usage:

(by 'Display deleted recordings now') or from the plugin's mainmenu entry (mainmenuentry visible from then mainmenu.
