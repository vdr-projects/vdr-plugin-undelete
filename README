Description:
============

This plugin allows to undelete from deleted recordings for a short time

When a recording is deleted in VDR, the recording is just marked for deletion. 
The removal of the files and directories is done in the background after a certain idle time
or when VDR needs more diskspace.

In case this cleanup process has not run, you can recover your deleted recordings 
with this plugin.

The plugin can also show the size of the deleted recordings and and immediate deletion
can be triggered.


Requirements:
=============

up to undelete-plugin v0.0.6: VDR >=1.3.8

undelete-plugin v0.0.7 and later: VDR >=1.5.7



Usage:
======

You can build the current list of deleted recordings from the plugin-setup menu 
(by 'Display deleted recordings now') or from the plugin's mainmenu entry (if 
mainmenuentry is visible in the main menu).

The keys for purge and salvage are adjustable in the plugin's setup


The plugin has the following SVDRP commands:

PLUG undelete LSTD    [ <number> ]   List deleted recordings
PLUG undelete SIZED   [ -h ]         Caclulate the size of deleted recordings
PLUG undelete RMDIR                  Start remove empty directory
PLUG undelete PURGE   ALL | <number> purge the selected deleted recording
